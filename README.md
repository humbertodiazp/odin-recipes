Basic Recipe Website 


This is a basic website to put into practice the knowledge I have learned up until now. This will demonstrate my understanding of various HTML elements and attributes, such as lists, links, and images. I will also be  using relative and absolute links when adding new pages to my website or linking to pages outside of my website. I will also do this when attaching images to my website, whether those images come from the web or from my website itself. Throughout this project I will continue to use the command line to create, move, delete, and rename files and directories.
